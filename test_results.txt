# Swift Unit Test Results

## Test Setup
- The Swift unit tests were executed on a Linux environment using the Swift Package Manager.
- The tests were generated using a Python script and placed in the `Tests/MyAppTests` directory.
- A `LinuxMain.swift` file was created to enable running tests on Linux.

## Test Execution
- The tests were run using the `swift test` command.
- The following test suites were executed:
  - CreateLoginUITests
  - ImplementUserAuthenticationBackendTests
  - SetUpCoreDataTests
  - DesignUserProfileViewTests
  - ImplementDataPersistenceLogicTests

## Test Results
- All tests passed successfully without any failures.
- The test execution was completed in approximately 0.102 seconds.

## Conclusion
The alternative method for running Swift unit tests on Linux was successfully implemented and verified. The setup is complete, and the tests can be executed reliably in the Linux environment.
